# IoT Sensor Network


## Description

We want to create a solution for monitoring the environment of classrooms or dorms.

## Deliverables

Python server application to collect data from clients.

Particle C++ application to collect data from sensors and send data to server.

Python GUI application to present useful charts and visualizations of current data and historical data.


Each of the sensor units will consist of a Particle IO microprocessor development board with several sensors connected to it. A computer would act as the server and each one of the sensor units would act as a client. Each of the sensor units will transmit sensor data over TCP or UDP to the server and the server would present a visualization of the data to the user and store the data for future analysis.

More deliverables to come soon.
